# calculator

    NOTE: One limitation that our calculator has is we have to give space separated expression
    correct ex: 2 + 3 or 5 / 2 - 3
    incorrect ex: 2+3 or 5/2-3 will be considered invalid
    
    This limiatation is independent of the caculator design, its how we take use input, we can resolve this limitation, without changing the caculator code
